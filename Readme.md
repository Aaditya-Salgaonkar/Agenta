**Built by**: Aaditya Salgaonkar

## ❓ The Problem

Thousands of teen founders and indie builders come up with great startup ideas — but most **never get built** due to:

- Lack of coding skills
- Long MVP timelines
- Expensive developer costs
- Complexity of no-code platforms

> ⚠️ There’s a *massive execution gap* in the early startup ecosystem.

## 💡 The Solution

**Agenta** is an AI-native platform that lets anyone — even with zero technical background — go from **idea → production-ready SaaS MVP** in minutes.

Just describe your idea in plain English.
Let AI handle the rest.
